## Overview

Timely is a workplace management tool designed to streamline and manage tasks among team members of the production team. The traditional task distribution through online messages, emails, and text messages is often challenged by the likelihood of several changes in deadlines, details, and members. In every change and task update, the chances of miscommunication significantly increase due to the asynchronous nature of the traditional method. This project was originally developed in an attempt to centralize the task assignments and updates instead of being distributed on various platforms. Traditional methods are also limited in providing context, especially if team members are working on different projects with similar tasks. For large organizations, it is inefficient and impractical to manually track the progress of the projects, and they are willing to avail expensive subscriptions to streamline tasks and improve productivity.
